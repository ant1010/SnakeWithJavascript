# SnakeWithJavascript
Welcome! This is a basic snake game I built using js. I used this project to familiarize myself with js; to help me better understand react.
This started off as a simple black line moving accross the screen. I slowyl added features and functionality as I learned about js. Also, just to spice things up
I added my own taste to this iconic game. I wanted to speed things up so I made it so that food spawns everytime the "up" direction is triggered instead of random 
spawning. Hope you like it!? [SnakeWithJS](https://snake-gamejs.herokuapp.com)

## About the build
- The ui/gameplay is completely vanilla.
- I used node, express, and nedb for the score tracking feature. It keeps track of players names along with their "best attempts" and "Top Score".
